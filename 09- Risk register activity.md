## Notes

* **Security Event Possibilities:**
    * How are security events possible considering the risks the asset faces in its operating environment?
* **High Priority Risks:**
    * Considering the likelihood and severity scales in this bank scenario the most probable occurrences are compromised user database and financial records leak due its poor security standards.
* **Moderate Priority Risks:**
    * But in the other hand thereâ€™s a moderate risk to have a supply chain disruption due to natural disaster factors.
* **Low Priority Risks:**
    * And looking for the risk of business e-mail compromise and theft risks we have low chances that those cases will happen because the volume of people on the city are low in analysing the scenario.
