# Incident Journal Entry

**Date:** April 14, 2025

## Description
Here we are documenting the incident that has occurred at a small U.S. health care clinic that has experienced a security incident that caused disruption in their business operations.

## Tool(s) used
I believe that in this case, the use of SIEM tools and reverse engineering tools for malware analysis would be helpful, but in the documentation provided, we donâ€™t have any clues that those tools were used.

## The 5 W's of the Incident
- **Who caused the incident?** Malicious hackers.
- **What happened?** The small U.S. health care business was a victim of a phishing attack that was perpetrated by a group of hackers demanding ransom in exchange for money.
- **When did the incident occur?** On Tuesday at 9:00 a.m.
- **Where did the incident happen?** A small U.S. health care clinic.
- **Why did the incident happen?** Because the clinic was vulnerable to a phishing attack made against several employees. Once the phishing was successful, the hacker group managed to infect the system with ransomware that incapacitated the systems using cryptography to make all systems useless and demand money to recover normal operations.

## Additional Notes
This is an example of a phishing attack that was perpetrated against a small business.
