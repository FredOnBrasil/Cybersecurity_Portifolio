## 🔍 Approach

This assessment was performed using the NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 risk assessment framework.

- **Selection Rationale:** Chosen risks reflect common and high-impact threat events for similar systems in our industry.
- **Scoring Methodology:**
  - *Likelihood* was estimated using historical logs, expert input, and threat intelligence.
  - *Severity* was evaluated based on operational impact and data sensitivity.
- **Limitations:**
  - Limited visibility into third-party vendors.
  - No live penetration tests conducted during this cycle.

## 🛠️ Remediation Strategy

To mitigate the risks identified, the following strategies are recommended:

### 🔧 Technical Controls
- Deploy and tune **firewalls and IDS** to detect network-based attacks.
- Enforce **encryption** for data at rest and in transit.
- Implement a **robust backup solution** with off-site storage.
- Maintain an up-to-date **patch management** process.

### ⚙️ Operational Controls
- Apply **role-based access control** and MFA.
- Enable **detailed logging and continuous monitoring**.
- Conduct **security awareness training** for employees.

### 🧑‍💼 Managerial Controls
- Schedule periodic **third-party security audits**.
- Update and test the **incident response plan**.
- Enhance **vendor risk management procedures**.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

The assessment has highlighted several high and moderate-risk scenarios. The outlined remediation steps provide actionable strategies to reduce exposure and improve the overall cybersecurity posture of the organization.
