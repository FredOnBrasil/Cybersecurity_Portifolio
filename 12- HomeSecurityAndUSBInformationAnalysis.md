# Home Security Analysis

## Question 1
At my home, the major attack vectors are the Wi-Fi network, doors, and windows, but the front door can be considered the most exposed to risk because it can be accessed directly. All the attack surfaces at any house are points of vulnerability and indeed need to be secured by all means to avoid being exploited.

## Question 2
To protect my home from various attack vectors, I can apply a combination of strategies and tools. First, securing the Wi-Fi network with a strong, unique password and enabling WPA3 encryption will help prevent unauthorized access. Furthermore, reinforcing doors and windows with quality locks and installing security cameras will deter potential intruders. I can also consider a smart home security system that alerts me to any unusual activity. Regularly reviewing and updating these security measures will ensure that my home remains protected against evolving threats.

# Device Information Analysis

## Types of Information
The device may contain various types of sensitive information including personally identifiable information (PII) such as social security numbers, financial details, and medical records. It could also house sensitive work files that pertain to hospital operations, patient data, and confidential communications. Storing personal files alongside work files is risky, as it increases the likelihood of accidental exposure or access by unauthorized individuals.

## Attacker Mindset
If an attacker gains access to this information, they could manipulate it to exploit Jorge or the hospital directly. For instance, they could perform identity theft or target other employees using their PII. Additionally, relatives could be put at risk through phishing attacks or other malicious activities, and if the threat actor gains access to the hospital's business files, it could compromise the organization's operational integrity and security.

## Risk Analysis
To mitigate the risks associated with this information, various technical, operational, and managerial controls should be implemented. Malicious software such as keyloggers or ransomware could be hidden on the device; if infected, it could lead to unauthorized access or data loss if discovered by another employee. Sensitive information that a actor might obtain includes patient records and employee details, which could then be exploited for financial gain or reputational damage. Implementing strong endpoint security, regular training on recognizing phishing attempts, and enforcing data access policies can help protect against these threats.
